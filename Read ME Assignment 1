# Assignment 1 READ ME 

1. For each member in your team, provide 1 paragraph detailing what parts of the lab that member 
implemented / researched. (You may skip this question if you are doing the lab by yourself).

I had done this lab by myself

2. Describe in detail the steps you used to complete the assignment. Consider your reader to be someone 
skilled in software development but otherwise unfamiliar with the assignment. Good answers to this 
question will be recipes that someone can follow to reproduce your development steps.
Note: I may decide to follow these instructions for random assignments, so you should make sure 
they are accurate.
